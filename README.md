# Plumage
*A Material Design Inspired CSS Framework*

Plumage is a material design inspired CSS framework. Built as part of a final project during my front-end web development program. With the help of other developers we each used our skillsets to create a an experience that required no tweaking out of the box. Inspired by material design, we wanted this framework to be clean and minimal without compromising on utility.

This project required us building a promotional website utilizing our own CSS framework.
